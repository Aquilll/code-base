You are given an Integer N.

You have to find how many different strings of length N can be made using Vowels (a, e, i, o, u) only and by following given rules :

‘a’ can only be followed by ‘e’ and ‘i’.

‘e’ can only be followed by ‘i’.

‘i’ can only be followed by ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘o’, and ‘u’.

‘o’ can only be followed by ‘a’ and ‘u’.

‘u’ can only be followed by ‘o’ and ‘e’.

for example N = 2

strings starting with 'a' of length 2 are:
    1. "ae"
    2. "ai"
strings starting with 'e' of length 2 are:
    1. "ei"
strings starting with 'i' of length 2 are:
    1. "ia"
    2. "io"
    3. "iu"
    4. "ie"
strings starting with 'o' of length 2 are:
    1. "oa"
    2. "ou"
strings starting with 'u' of length 2 are:
    1. "uo"
    2. "ue"

so total number of strings can be made using vowels and following above rules will be 11.
